# CLAUDE.md — Idle Sails

Orientation for a fresh session. Read this first, then `PLAN.md`.

## What this is

**Idle Sails** — a browser **idler** for the age of sail. Leave the tab open and
a procedurally generated, historically-grounded world sails itself: plausible
vessels (names, rigs, tonnages, flags, cargoes) set out on realistic
wind-and-current routes between historical ports, cross the world, and are lost
or arrive over accelerated time. The player is a **spectator** — the entire
control surface is a **speed slider** and **click-a-vessel → sidebar** (tonnage ·
ship type · allegiance · cargo · itinerary). Nothing to build, buy, or win.

This is a **ground-up rebuild**. The previous project was an isochronic passage
*chart* (a static travel-time map); it is archived, not deleted, because its
routing engine powers the idler's movement.

## Current state (as of 2026-07-08)

- **Phase: planning complete, no app code written yet.** The full design lives in
  `PLAN.md`. Next action is **Milestone 1** (author the `data-src/` datasets).
- **Git:** initialized; branch `main`; pushed to
  **`https://github.com/casusscribere/idle-sails` (private)**. Remote `origin` is
  stored **token-free** (HTTPS). Local is in sync with `origin/main`.
- No `data-src/`, `pipeline/` (new), or `app/` directories exist yet — those are
  the *target* layout described in `PLAN.md §8`, to be created during the build.

## Repo layout right now

## Key documents

- **`PLAN.md`** — the design: assumed decisions (§0), reused assets (§1),
  architecture (§2), the six historical datasets (§3), the procedural generator
  (§4), the sim loop + idle mechanics (§5), offline route baking (§6), rendering
  & UI (§7), tech/layout (§8), milestones (§9), open questions (§10).
- **`archive/isochrone-v1/ARCHIVE-NOTE.md`** — what the old project was and
  exactly which of its assets the rebuild reuses.
- **`archive/isochrone-v1/SOURCES.md`** — historical sourcing + calibration
  report grounding the datasets.

## Reused from the archive (do not delete without porting forward)

- `archive/isochrone-v1/pipeline/ports.json` — 15 georeferenced historical ports.
- `archive/isochrone-v1/docs/data/fields/*.bin` + `pipeline/router.mjs` — the
  wind/current/polar least-time engine. Run **once, offline** to bake curved
  route polylines (`PLAN.md §6`); the 31 MB fields are **not** shipped at runtime.
- `archive/isochrone-v1/docs/app.js → routeFrom()` — downhill route-walk to port,
  to be ported into the offline route baker.
- `archive/isochrone-v1/docs/assets/land.geojson` — coastline for the map.

## Decisions assumed (chosen while the user was away — NOT yet confirmed)

See `PLAN.md §0`. Flag these for confirmation before deep work depends on them:

1. **Movement:** bake route polylines offline from the archived fields; ship only
   the polylines (not the 31 MB fields).
2. **Persistence:** persist to `localStorage` with offline-accrual fast-forward.
3. **Era scope:** lock to ~1700–1815 (matches the calibrated data).

Still open (`PLAN.md §10`): renderer choice (canvas — recommended — vs. MapLibre,
settle at Milestone 4); and the sober, non-gamified treatment of the slave trade,
which is historically central to this dataset.

## Working notes

- Environment: WSL2 Linux; primary dir `/home/kirk/REPOS_LINUX/idle_sails`.
- No `gh` CLI and no passwordless sudo here. GitHub ops go through the REST API /
  HTTPS with a user-supplied PAT. The PATs used during setup should be treated as
  compromised (they appeared in a chat transcript) and rotated.
- `.gitignore` excludes `node_modules/`, `pipeline/build/`, `*.log`. The archived
  `node_modules` is correctly excluded; the 31 MB of archived field data **is**
  committed on purpose (reusable engine output).
